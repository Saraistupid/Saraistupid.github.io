                        <br>
                        My main contributions are to the <a href="https://rheavenstudio.github.io/docs/intro">Heaven Studio</a> project, I used to maintain the documentations, I also did the Linux and MacOS fixes for the editor itself.

                        I also had an internet radio called Troontunes that will hopefully be online again if I ever find a host for it.

                        Two of my Rhythm Heaven custom remixes are worth mentioning too: <a href="https://youtu.be/5srPHovbEs4">MrBeast Stole The Precious Thing</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/b2wn_ORk0J4">Roddy Ricch - Ballin</a>
