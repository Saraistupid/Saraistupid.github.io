                    <p>What is After Effects and How do I use it?
                    </p>

                    <p>Adobe After Effects is a industry standard tool used for visual effects and motion graphics. Or, at the very least that's what it's supposed
                        to be used for.
                    </p>

                    <p>Learning After Effects is a bit of a learning curve, depending 
                        on what you want to do.
                        <br>
                        For example, YTPMVs/éŸ³MAD is a type of video where audio is manipulated to make a song, and while After Effects
                        cant make the audio, it is an extremely popular program for the visual side of things. 
                    </p>

                    <p>While I'll try my best in the future to give you information on
                        Shader Graphs, Masking, Layer Switching, Motion Tracking, 3D and Effects. There are people who are way
                        smarter than me who could probably explain it a lot better than I ever could.
                        Here are some people who you should check out for more information, programs that go outside of After Effects. Like
                        Reaper, Cinema4D, Blender, Vegas Pro and more.
