                    <b>TL;DR: I basically don't care what you are, what you do, what you think, or what you are into, as long you aren't any of the people I mentioned in the DNI list. <br>The DNI list simplified is as following: cucks, annoying people, people who find child abuse funny</b>

                    <h1>My DNI list is as following:</h1>
                    <h3>Cucks or cheaters (in relationships)</h3>
                        <p>You are honestly the scum of earth if you are into cuckold and find it hot, same for anyone who cheats and finds it a good thing to do.

                    <h3>Annoyingly retarded people</h3>
                    <p>I don't have to explain this one, you get what I mean.

                    <h3>People who make their ideology/opinions/fetishes/kinks their entire personality</h3>
                    <p>Please shut the fuck up and consider getting a fucking life if you do that :3

                    <h3>Niggers who make jokes about abusing their (future) children</h3>
                    <p>It isn't funny, it's disgusting, you should fucking kill yourself if you even consider anything like that remotely funny.

                    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
                    <h3>Why aren't the usual stuff like "homophobes" or "transphobes" on here?</h3>
                    <p>Because it's incredibly retarded to add that, they'd interact even more if I put them here, and I honestly don't care about them.</p>

                    <h3>Anyone of an extremist political ideology?</h3>
                    <p>I believe in an extremist political ideology</p>

                    <h3>Well, what about pro-fiction/proship?</h3>
                    <p>I do not care if you are either, infact, go on buddy, do whatever you want.</p>

                    <h3>Pedophiles? Zoos? Necros? Any of those?</h3>
                    <p>I don't care either, as long they are non-contact/anti-contact, why should I care?</p>
