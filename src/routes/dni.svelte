                    <b>TL;DR: I basically don't care what you are, what you do, what you think, or what you are into, as long you aren't any of the people I mentioned in the DNI list. <br>The DNI list simplified is as following: cucks, annoying people, people who find child abuse funny</b>

                    <br>
                    <h1>My DNI list is as following:</h1>
                    <h3>Cucks or cheaters in relationships</h3>
                    <p>You're honestly the scum of earth if you're into being cucked or you find cheating moral.</p>

                    <h3>Annoyingly retarded people</h3>
                    <p>Being retarded is one thing, but being the annoying kind of retarded is something else.</p>

                    <h3>People who make their ideology/opinions/fetishes/kinks their entire personality</h3>
                    <p>Consider getting a life please. There's so much you could possibly talk about in the little time we have on earth, yet you waste it talking about this kind of shit.</p>

                    <h3>Cunts who make jokes about abusing children</h3>
                    <p>You are genuinely disgusting. It's harrowing to acknowledge how people like you can exist. Whether you're joking or not, your intentions harm people - but trying to make light of it using jokes is a completely other realm of shittiness that you have entered. Jokes are supposed to be funny.</p>

                    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
                    <h3>Why aren't the usual stuff like "homophobes" or "transphobes" on here?</h3>
                    <p>If I added that, many homophobes and transphobes would only interact <i>more</i> with my own website and social medias than if I simply didn't mention it at all - so no, I won't include obvious shit.</p>

                    <h3>Anyone who affiliates with an extremist political ideology?</h3>
                    <p>I myself believe in an extremist political ideology. Extremism isn't an inherently bad thing.</p>

                    <h3>What about profictioners or proshippers?</h3>
                    <p>Couldn't care less. You have your own individual liberties that I don't want to step on, so go for it.</p>

                    <h3>Pedophiles? Zoophiles? Necrophiles? Any other strange paraphilic disorder?</h3>
                    <p>Attraction is developed through a person's life and no amount of therapy or counseling would ever 'cure' or 'fix' you. If you are anti-contact and especially non-contact, then I can't possibly care to restrict you from my own spaces because of an attraction you have no chance of controlling.</p>
